# Knowledge is the key
## Science is the supporting tool
Education is necessary:
- To know yourself
- To know your environment

Useful methods:
- physical referent: something you can touch or experiment with
- hidden layer: automatically learn necessary steps to map input to output, e.g. 2x3 = 1x3 + 1x3 learning addition to multiply numbers
